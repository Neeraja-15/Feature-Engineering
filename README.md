## 🚀 Getting Started

Start with the Jupyter notebooks in the `notebooks/` directory. You can launch them using:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

Each notebook is self-contained and demonstrates specific techniques with examples.

## 🧪 Sample Dataset

For demonstration purposes, we use publicly available datasets like:
- Titanic
- UCI Adult Income
- Synthetic datasets created with `sklearn.datasets`

## 📊 Tools and Libraries

- Python 3.x
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib, seaborn (for visualization)
- jupyter notebook
